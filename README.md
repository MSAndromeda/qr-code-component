## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Google Fonts (Outfit)
- Box-shadow and border-radius for card styling

### What I learned

This was my first challenge from Frontend Mentor. Even though it's a simple one, it helped me practice writing semantic HTML and clean CSS. A few things I focused on:

- Creating a centered layout using Flexbox
- Matching the Figma design exactly
- Using `box-shadow` instead of `filter: drop-shadow()` for layout elements
- Understanding when to use things like `min-content` and `inline-block` to size elements based on content

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my accessibility practices
- Practice writing even cleaner, more scalable CSS
- Get more comfortable using semantic tags like `<figure>`, `<section>`, etc. where appropriate
- Try writing the same layout in TailwindCSS or with utility classes
